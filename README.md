# Changelog

## Changelog 1

There hasn't been a changelog before this one so tada!

New in version {{version}}
- This cool changelog tracking feature
- Better ways to track issues (on vixi's end)
- Better stability and loading
- Removed some ppl from the holes queue (with plans to make it registerable next update)
- Removed unused services (`ARP_WATCH`, `STAT_GET`)

More to come! I'll have `/register` and `/deregister` working for the holes next update. And hopefully a booru search feature!

## Changelog 2

Ok! Kinda half baked, but news for <@&1248737660315635754>s!

I have added the `/register` and `/deregister` commands, they may be slightly buggy but my early testing says they worked mostly ok! I have some big plans tho and I just wanted to add a quick way right now for people to quickly join and leave when they wish. (dont want anyone being spammed unwillingly).
